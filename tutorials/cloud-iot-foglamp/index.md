# Using Dianomic FogLamp with Google Cloud IoT Core

FogLamp from Dianomic provides a robust solution for getting data from sensors
into data stores.  The following diagram illustrates the platform architecture
for FogLamp in the context of Google Cloud IoT Core (Cloud Iot Core).


In the context of getting data into Google Cloud from sensors, the FogLamp
architecture consists of a service that bridges sensors that communicate
through FogLamp using the "South" service to Google Cloud Platform as a data
store on the "North" service.

For this quickstart we'll be using a Raspberry Pi to host the FogLamp service.

## Setup your Raspberry Pi with the Raspbian Buster image
This tutorial requires that you use the Debian Buster version of the Raspberry
Pi software because it uses packages built for that verision of Linux. To get
Buster on your Raspberry Pi, first download a Raspbian buster image from the
[Raspbian downloads page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

Next, unzip the image you downloaded, which will create a file that ends in
`.img`. For example, if you downloaded the "full" version of Raspbian, the
file would be named `2019-09-26-raspbian-buster-full.img`.

After you have unzipped the image file, create the SD card image for your
Raspberry Pi using a disk image utility. Raspberry Pi recommends that you use
[balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

For more information about flashing your Raspberry Pi, see the detailed instructions
on [the Raspberry Pi install documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md).

At this point, you will need to set up access the Raspberry Pi. If you intend
to access the Raspberry Pi in headless mode, follow the instructions for
[setting up headless](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md)
on the Raspberry Pi site. Otherwise, connect your Raspberry Pi to a keyboard,
mouse, and display for local access.

Finally, you will want to do any final configuration of the Raspberry Pi with
the [raspi-config](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md)
utility such as expanding the filesystem and setting the user password.

You will be performing subsequent steps on the Raspberry Pi itself either over
SSH if you're working headless or on the Raspberry Pi hardware if you're using
the Desktop UI.

## Download the FogLamp packages
From your Raspberry Pi, download the FogLamp packages to the file system. For
the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be placing them in a folder named
`foglamp` in your user's home directory.

```
mkdir $HOME/foglamp
cd $HOME/foglamp
wget https://foglamp.s3.amazonaws.com/1.7.0/buster/armv7l/foglamp-1.7.0_armv7l_buster.tgz
tar -xzvf  foglamp-1.7.0_armv7l_buster.tgz
```

The folder will now have the base packages for FogLamp. Let's also download the
packages for the Google Cloud IoT Core North plugin.

```
wget
https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/community/tree/master/tutorials/cloud-iot-foglamp/foglamp-north-gcp-1.7.0.arm71.tgz
tar -xzvf foglamp-north-gcp-1.7.0-arm71.tgz
```

At this point, the `foglamp` folder in your user's home directly will contain
all the requirements for getting your Raspberry Pi up and running.

## Install FogLamp and FogLamp GUI on your Raspberry Pi

After setting up your Raspberry Pi with the Raspbian Buster image and getting
the FogLamp packages, it's time to install the FogLamp service and FogLamp GUI.

The FogLamp Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes it easier to configure and
control FogLamp from your Raspberry Pi.

Browse to the folder that you downloaded the FogLamp packages to and install
the FogLamp and FogLamp GUI packages.
```
pushd $HOME/foglamp/foglamp/1.7.0/buster/armv7l/
sudo apt -y install foglamp-1.7.0-armv7l.deb
sudo apt -y install foglamp-gui-1.7.0.deb
```

Now you can start the FogLamp service and check its status.

```
export FOGLAMP_ROOT=/usr/local/foglamp
$FOGLAMP_ROOT/bin/foglamp start
$FOGLAMP_ROOT/bin/foglamp status
```

You can also start the FogLamp GUI with the command:
